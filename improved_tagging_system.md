# Practical Tagging System for Ancient Civilizations

## Core Principles
- Quality over quantity: 2-3 meaningful tags per event
- Always include primary civilization
- Focus on what users would filter by
- Consolidate similar concepts

## Tag Categories

### 1. CIVILIZATIONS (Primary Tags)
**Major Powers:**
- Egypt, Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian, Assyrian
- Hittite, Mitanni, Elamite, Amorite
- Greek, Persian, Sea Peoples

### 2. THEMES (Secondary Tags)  
**Military:** Defense, Siege, Battle, Navy
**Political:** Dynasty, Treaty, Unification, Law
**Cultural:** Architecture, Writing, Religion, Art
**Economic:** Trade, Agriculture, Mining, Resources
**Technology:** Engineering, Metallurgy, Innovation
**Environment:** Climate Crisis, Natural Disaster

### 3. KEY FIGURES (When Applicable)
- Major rulers: Sargon, Hammurabi, Ramesses, etc.
- Important individuals who drive searches

## Examples of Improved Tagging

### Before (Problems):
- "Wall of the Ruler Built": ["Fortification", "Defense", "Border"] 
  → Missing Egypt, 3 redundant concepts
- "Fall of Akkadian Empire": ["Collapse", "Empire", "Drought"]
  → Missing Akkadian, impractical generic tags

### After (Practical):
- "Wall of the Ruler Built": ["Egypt", "Defense"]
- "Fall of Akkadian Empire": ["Akkadian", "Climate Crisis"]
- "Battle of Kadesh": ["Egypt", "Hittite", "Battle"]
- "Code of Hammurabi": ["Babylonian", "Law", "Hammurabi"]

## Benefits
- Users can filter by civilization effectively
- Consolidated concepts reduce noise
- Focus on actionable search criteria
- Better historical context preservation
